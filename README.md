# MVCCRUDProject
This project was made by Sam Ryzek using C.R.U.D (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methodology. The subject of the project was our solar system's planets. On a grander scale, this project could be expanded to allow for the addition of other stars and planets. Further application expansion could allow for moon addition in a nested form. Further functionality will include photos of the planets when they are called along with a more pleasent presentation of planet information.

The technology used in this project was Spring, HTML/CSS, and Java. 

There were many challenges encountered during the creation of this application. Implementation of the update functionality was the most challenging aspect of the application design. The program was designed to delete the planet object that was identified through a name string. Once the update was completed, a new object with the same name was added back into the arraylist of planet objects. This method worked, but control was lost on where the new planet would be placed into the arraylist. Ultimately, through numerous iterations, a somewhat working version was created and implemented. However, functionality seems to be inconsistent and buggy.
